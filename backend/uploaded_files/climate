Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. These changes result in global warming, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events.

To combat climate change, countries around the world have signed international agreements like the Paris Accord. Efforts include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and reducing emissions.

Individuals can also make a difference by conserving energy, reducing waste, and supporting sustainable practices.
