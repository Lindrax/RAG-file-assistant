Artificial Intelligence (AI) research began in the 1950s. One of the earliest goals of AI was to create systems that could mimic human reasoning. Over the decades, AI has evolved from rule-based systems to machine learning and, more recently, deep learning and large language models.

In the 21st century, AI technologies have become increasingly powerful, with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more. Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta have pushed the boundaries of AI research.

Modern AI systems can now generate text, answer questions, drive cars, and even beat humans at complex games like Go.
